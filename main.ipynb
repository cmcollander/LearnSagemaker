    "To see how your tuning job is doing, jump over to the SageMaker console.  Under the **Training** section, you'll see Hyperparameter tuning jobs, where you'll see the newly created job.  It will launch a series of TrainingJobs in your account, each of which will behave like a regular training job.  They will show up in the list, and when each job is completed, you'll see the final value they achieved for mean reward.  Each job will also emit algorithm metrics to cloudwatch, which you can see plotted in CloudWatch metrics.  To see these, click on the training job to det to its detail page, and then look for the link \"View algorithm metrics\" which will let you see a chart of how that job is progressing.  By changing the search criteria in the CloudWatch console, you can overlay the metrics for all the jobs in this tuning job."
